## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Version**: Ensure you have Python 3.9.10 installed.

2. **Git CLI**: Install Git to clone the repository if you haven't already. You can download zip directly from GitHub if you prefer not to use Git.
3. **Virtual Environment**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bsushsiwba/pyqt-audio-services
   cd pyqt-audio-services
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python --version  # Ensure it's Python 3.9.10
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - For Google Cloud services, save your JSON key file (e.g., `my-key.json`) and set the environment variable in env along with other cloud service credentials.
     - copy .env.example to .env and fill in the required credentials
       ```bash
         cp .env.example .env
       ```
     - Open and add all the required credentials in the `.env` file.
   - Updating `Google_json_path`,
     - Windows: Use double backslashes `C:\\path\\to\\your\\my-key.json`
     - macOS/Linux: Use single forward slashes `/path/to/your/my-key.json`
